# Email Scheduler
_A simple way to schedule email from SendGrid, using Iron.io_

## Usage
To use, simply [queue a task](http://dev.iron.io/worker/#tasks) for your worker, with the task's payload set to any of the [JSON accepted by SendGrid's Node Library](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs#available-params) and `api_user` and `api_key`.

### Example Payload
```json
{
  "api_user" : "YOUR_SENDGRID_USERNAME",
  "api_key" :  "YOUR_SENDGRID_PASSWORD",
  "to" : "nick@sendgrid.com",
  "from" : "nick@sendgrid.com",
  "subject" : "Look at this cool email!",
  "text" : "I mean seriously, it was scheduled with Iron.io-- so cool!"
}
```

### Examples
Examples for using this code can be found in the [examples branch](https://github.com/nquinlan/sendgrid-scheduler/tree/examples) of this repo. Further information on how and why to implement this can be found on [the SendGrid Blog](http://sendgrid.com/blog/schedule-email-sendgrid-iron-io/).

## Setup
To get this Worker running, do the following:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/nquinlan/sendgrid-scheduler`
2. Move into the repo: `cd sendgrid-scheduler`
3. Place your `iron.json` file in the repo: _e.g._ `mv ~/Downloads/iron.json ./` (You can download your `iron.json` by clicking credentials then "Download iron.json" found in your project, while on the [Iron.io HUD](https://hud.iron.io/))
4. Upload the worker: `iron_worker upload SendGridScheduler` (This requires the `iron_worker` gem, you can get it with `gem install iron_worker`)
